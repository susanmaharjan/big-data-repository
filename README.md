## Current

I am a senior, working on a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in System Management.

## Background

I am from Kathmandu, Nepal. I like playing basketball, soccer, table tennis and running. I like adventures. I have done white water rafting, parasailing, trekking, and have tried all the adventurous rides in all the amusement parks that I have been to.

  

## Plans

Firstly I want to complete my undergraduate then finish the Masters of Applied Computer Science. After that I see my self working as a web developer or software developer or as a day analyst.
